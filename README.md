This memory game project was created using React so to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Game Obective

This application renders different images on screen that get reshuffled each time they are clicked. The user's score increments when the image is not selected more than twice, and if it is cliced twice, the user loses. The top score is 12 (number of cartoon character). The user's score will reset to 0 if the same image is selected more than once.

`GOOD LUCK`
